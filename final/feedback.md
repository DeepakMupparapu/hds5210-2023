The grading rubric for the final can be found in GitHub: https://github.com/paulboal/hds5210-2023/blob/main/final/final-instructions.pdf

**Functional Requirements**
* 5 points - Uses data from at least two different sources: local file, internet, web service, relational database, AWS S3, etc; and formats: CSV, JSON, database, XML, Excel, etc
* 5 points - Data from multiple sources has to be joined together at least twice
* 5 points - Data is aggregated or pivoted at least twice during the program
* 5 points - Some kind of field-level transformation is performed at least 5 times
* 5 points - The program creates 3 or more data visualizations 
* 5 points - The program serves a theoretical purpose described in documentation, that could potentially do something in healthcare or another industry of interest

**Modularity / Style**
* 15 points - The code is broken up into various functions or classes to make testing and reuse easier

**Documentation and Professionalism**
* 15 points - All functions are documented and notebook cells include annotations and explanations.

**(-3) You only performed one merge/join. Two were required for full credit.**

**(-2) Throughout, you have some small notes about what you're doing next, but there's little narrative telling us WHY we're doing what we're doing.**

**(-1) Variable names like `pivoted_data` and `data` aren't clear enough. They should tell the reader what data they have in them based on the variable's name.**

**Overall, the project was solid.  Fun to do a little predictive modeling, right!?**
